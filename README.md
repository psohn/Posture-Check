# Posture-Check
OpenCV Facial Tracker For Posture Checking

### Motivation
As a long time computer user, I have noticed that my posture is consistently poor - I usually slouch very far down on my chair. I believe that due to my poor posture, my neck muscles are poorly developed and I consistently get neck and shoulder pains that persist for days. In order to prevent this, I have decided to create an OpenCV based program to warn me when my posture is bad using facial detection. 

### How it Works
The program will use simple face recognition haar cascades using OpenCV to detect if the user is upright or slouched. For example:

![Good Posture](https://i.gyazo.com/c99fb965fe43850725ca51d8e4defc2e.jpg)

If the face detected is vertically below a threshold, the person is considered to be slouching.

![Bad Posture](https://i.gyazo.com/c3ecfe5e0dbb15411bec614ca111c82d.jpg)

After a certain amount of time of slouching, the program will play a sound. For my program, I have chosen to make the sound a clip of music generated by my music GAN.
